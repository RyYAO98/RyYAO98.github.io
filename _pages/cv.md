Research Experience
======
* Prediction-based Truck Platoon Control, 2022.04-*Present*
  * PhD Student, Advisor: Prof. Xiaotong SUN
  * Duty: (updated after manuscript submission)

* Federated Learning for Generalizable Traffic Simulation, 2022.03-2022.07 (expected)
  * Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Zhaoshui HE
  * Duty: Independently implemented trajectory-prediction backbone VectorNet on INTERACTION benchmark. Developed a federated learning scheme for improving the generalizability of deep learning models when applied to traffic simulation in multiple variant sites.

* Deep Learning for COVID-19 Detection with CT Images, 2021.06-2022.02
  * Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Zhaoshui HE
  * Duty: Explored the availability of ResNet50, DenseNet161, EfficientNet-B7 and GhostNet on four COVID-19 classification benchmarks (e.g. COVIDx-CT, HUST-19). Cooperated in proposing sample separation strategy that converts conventional training into a two-stage training, boosted the accuracy by up to 9.46% on a single model.

* Modeling and Simulation of Dynamic Shared Autonomous Taxi Dispatching System, 2019.07-2021.02
  * Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Weiliang ZENG
  * Duty: Independently proposed deep learning framework DIIA-Net for modelling vehicle turning behaviour at mixed-flow intersections. A LSTM-based network is employed to encode vehicle historical motion features. Then, each vehicleâ€™s potential target lanes are identified with a probabilistic method, followed by a pooling module to extract dynamic intention features. GAT and a synthesized network are introduced to model homogeneous interaction and heterogeneous interaction respectively. Finally, multiple kinds of obtained features are sent to a LSTM-based decoder, where both future displacement and body orientation are generated. Independently implemented the proposed network with PyTorch framework, which achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with En-Dec baseline, VP-LSTM and Conv-LSTM.
